- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Austin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything Python!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a self taught software engineer (currently working as a software engineer on an inventory management web application).  I gained my knowledge of the industry through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, and Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course.
- âš¡ Current Work: I'm working on increasing my understanding of front end frameworks by going through The Odin Project's Foundations
