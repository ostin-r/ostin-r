- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Austin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reliable, fast, and robust software!
- âš¡ Current Work: I'm currently working on personal projects to help bridge the gap between my background in chemical engineering and software engineering- these include a "lox" (toy language) interpreter, command line utilities, and a ground-up text editor
- ðŸŒ± When I'm not working on personal projects, I am working my day job as a software engineer optimizing in-house web applications used for warehouse management
