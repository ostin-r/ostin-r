- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ostin-r
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything Python!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning general programming principles in python through the textbook "Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart
- âš¡ For the future: I plan on taking a deep dive on data structures and algorithms, then I'll move to learning some common frameworks for Python
