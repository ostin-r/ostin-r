- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Austin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything Python!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a self taught software engineer (currently working as a software engineer on an inventory management web application).  I gained my knowledge of the industry through "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, and Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course.
- âš¡ Current Work: I'm working on increasing my understanding of test driven development with the free book: [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html)
