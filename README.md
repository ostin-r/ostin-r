- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything Python!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning general programming principles through Harvard's CS50 introduction to computer science course!
- âš¡ For the future: I plan on taking a deep dive on data structures and algorithms, before moving to learning how to use common python frameworks such as Django & Flask
