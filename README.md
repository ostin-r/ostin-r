- 👋 Hi, I’m Austin
- 👀 I’m interested in everything Python!
- 🌱 I’m a self-taught software engineer, currently working on an inventory management web application.  I graduated in chemical engineering and broke into the industry through a collection of online learning material including "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart, Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course, and The Odin Project.
- ⚡ Current Work: I'm working on increasing my skillset through building my own projects.  Currently on my to-do list: A django RESTful API for stoic quotes, a ground-up text editor, and a neovim plugin
- 💪🏼 Strenghts: React, Django, and Test-Driven Development
